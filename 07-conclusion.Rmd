# Conclusions

The experiment answered the teams research questions to some extent, but the experiment did not yield the expected conclusions.

> Does a study guide accompanying the reading assignment improve reading recall for both personality types?

In the aggregate, the population performs better on reading memory recall questions after guidance is provided that narrows the focus of the reading assignment.

> Is the improvement in recall from the study guide different between the two personality types?

Intuitive (low-detail) personality types end up with lower scores after receiving the treatment, while Sensing (high-detail) personality types end up with higher scores. Given a non-experimental difference between the Sensing (high-detail) and Intuitive (low-detail) personality types in the control group, this heterogeneous treatment effect brings the scores of the population closer together.
